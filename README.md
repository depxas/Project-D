# Project-D

## Setup 
#### 1.  Go to your gitlab and onto the repo called Project-D, where it says "code<>" press that and see what it says e.g. "https://github.com/depxas/Project-D.git" the .git is very important here
#### 2.  Go to file explorer and find where you have your unity projects stored will probably be in Documents/Unity Games. 
####     Once in the correct directory right click anywhere in the file explorer and an option for "Git Bash here..." should come up:

#### 3.  Once the git bash terminal opens you will see which file or directory you are currently looking at to the left of the command line like so:
![image](https://github.com/depxas/Project-D/assets/132231097/10001b24-6872-4d12-84d1-11da213b8797)
####     The yellow text here is the current directory, now if you type the following commands exactly as they are written it should download all the files by 'cloning' them from the online git repository.
#### 4.  Make sure the current directory (in yellow) ends in "Unity Games" like in the ss above.
#### 5.  Then, using the url you got earlier from step 1. type the following into the git bash Command Line: git clone "https://github.com/depxas/Project-D.git" 
#### 6.  Once done go into the directory using "cd Project-D" in the command line.
#### 7.  Now you need to create a blank 2D-Built-in-Render-Pipeline project and copy all the files (MAKE SURE TO SKIP ALL FILES WITH THE SAME NAME DO NOT OVERWRITE!!!!!!) from the blank 2D-BiP project to the Project-D folder  
#### 8.  Now onto Unity, open the unity hub and go to the projects tab, once there click the "add" button thats near the top right and chose the newly created "Project-D" directory
####     you should be able to run these projects now by clicking on the editor version column and then "Open with 2022.etc.etc"
